## Instructions

‚ùóÔ∏èExclamation Marks ‚ùóÔ∏èindicate action items; you should remove these emoji as you complete/update the items which 
  they accompany. (This means that your final README should have no ‚ùóÔ∏èin it!)

## Milestone 1: Setup, Planning, Design

**Title**: `TurtlEvasion!`

**Purpose**: `This project is a clicking game where players tap a randomly appearing turtle to earn points within a 
20-second timer.`

**Source Assignment(s)**: `T02: Exploring Turtles, T03: Boustrophedon Turtles, HW06: Oh The Places You'll Go, 
HW02: Loopy Turtles and HW 03: Fully Functional Gitty Psychedelic Robotic Turtles. We are planning to use as many 
things we need in order to complete this project. We have a lot of source assignments listed but we will use 
certain things from each one because each assignment has new things about turtle. `

**CRC Card(s)**:
  - Create a CRC card for each class that your project will implement.
  - See this link for a sample CRC card and a template to use for your own cards (you will have to make a copy to edit):
    [CRC Card Example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JE_3Qmytk_JGztRqkPXWACJwciPH61VCx3idIlBCVFY/edit?usp=sharing)
  - Tables in markdown are not easy, so we suggest saving your CRC card as an image and including the image(s) in the 
    README. You can do this by saving an image in the repository and linking to it. See the sample CRC card below - 
    and REPLACE it with your own:

**Branches**: This project will **require** effective use of git. 

Each partner should create a branch at the beginning of the project, and stay on this branch (or branches of their 
branch) as they work. When you need to bring each others branches together, do so by merging each other's branches 
into your own, following the process we've discussed in previous assignments, then re-branching out from the merged code.  

```
    Branch 1 starting name: kushals branch - phuyelk
    Branch 2 starting name: naz's branch - tulegenovan
```

### References 

Throughout this project, you will likely use outside resources. Reference all ideas which are not your own, 
and describe how you integrated the ideas or code into your program. This includes online sources, people who have 
helped you, AI tools you've used, and any other resources that are not solely your own contribution. Update this 
section as you go. DO NOT forget about it!

```
    we used ChatGPT when we got absolutely stuck, and needed some guidance. We used it to help us guide us in the right 
    directions when we got stuck. We also used the PyCharm game dictionary along with the Tkinter, we also had to track back
    to some of the HW and TW to get ideas on how to use randit, and things of that sort. 
```

## Milestone 2: Code Setup and Issue Queue

Most importantly, keep your issue queue up to date, and focus on your code. üôÉ

Reflect on what you‚Äôve done so far. How‚Äôs it going? Are you feeling behind/ahead? What are you worried about? 
What has surprised you so far? Describe your general feelings. Be honest with yourself; this section is for you, not me.

```
    We are feeling good about our project, we made a lot of progress and I feel that we are ahead of others. 
    Only thing that has us worried is how we will implement the different difficulty levels into the game. But overall,
    we are doing well and cooperating well and also putting in equal amount of efforts and work. 
```

## Milestone 3: Virtual Check-In

Indicate what percentage of the project you have left to complete and how confident you feel. 

**Completion Percentage**: `85%`

**Confidence**: Describe how confident you feel about completing this project, and why. Then, describe some 
  strategies you can employ to increase the likelihood that you'll be successful in completing this project 
  before the deadline.

```
    Very confident, we are almost done, and we have been progressing greatly. Something we can keep doing to ensure
    we get this done is keep working on it together, diving everything into small tasks, and make progress everytime we do. While we‚Äôve encountered some 
    challenges, especially with timer and visibility for the fake.png, we‚Äôve been able to solve them through testing 
    and iteration. This gives us confidence that we can handle any remaining issues.

```

## Milestone 4: Final Code, Presentation, Demo

### ‚ùóUser Instructions

In a paragraph, explain how to use your program. Assume the user is starting just after they hit the "Run" button 
in PyCharm. 

### ‚ùóErrors and Constraints

Every program has bugs or features that had to be scrapped for time. These bugs should be tracked in the issue queue. 
You should already have a few items in here from the prior weeks. Create a new issue for any undocumented errors and 
deficiencies that remain in your code. Bugs found that aren't acknowledged in the queue will be penalized.

### ‚ùóPeer Evaluation

It is important that all members of your team contribute equitably. The peer evaluation is your chance to either 
a) celebrate the great work you all did together as an effective team, or b) indicate to the instructor if a member of
your team did not contribute their fair share. Grades will be adjusted for any team member who is evaluated poorly. Your
commit history will be used as evidence, so make sure you are using git effectively!

### ‚ùóReflection

Each partner should write three to four well-written paragraphs address the following (at a minimum):
- Why did you select the project that you did?
- How closely did your final project reflect your initial design?
- What did you learn from this process?
- What was the hardest part of the final project?
- What would you do differently next time, knowing what you know now?
- How well did you work with your partner? What made it go well? What made it challenging?

```
    Partner 1: **Replace this text with your reflection
```

```
    Partner 2: **Replace this text with your reflection
```
